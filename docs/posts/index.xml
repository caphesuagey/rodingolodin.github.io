      <description>So what did I learn? Don&amp;rsquo;t rush with making a career decision. Do a research on the company that you want to commit some of your time to. Research the industry. Research the companies finances to the best of your abilities. See how they communicate with you - do they give you timely updates? Are they generally responsive and respectful of your time? The way the company handles communication with you before they hire you can reveal to you how the communication will go after you&amp;rsquo;re hired.</description>
