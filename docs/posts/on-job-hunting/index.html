          <p>So what did I learn? Don&rsquo;t rush with making a career decision. Do a research on the company that you want to commit some of your time to. Research the industry. Research the companies finances to the best of your abilities. See how they communicate with you - do they give you timely updates? Are they generally responsive and respectful of your time? The way the company handles communication with you before they hire you can reveal to you how the communication will go after you&rsquo;re hired. Check if the different departments are in sync.</p>
<p>Positive experiences? Are there any? Sure. If you genuinely made it to the very last stage of the interview process And didn&rsquo;t get an offer, It still means that your skills are valuable, And the company is so something in you. The mantra that I like to use is: It&rsquo;s not always about you. In my personal experience, I tend to attribute good things to luck and bad things to An expected outcome. This is just how I am wired and it&rsquo;s a topic for another post. It really isn&rsquo;t always about you. Sometimes some organizational processes get in the way and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it. Sometimes your hiring manager leaves in your position is stuck in limbo. Sometimes the department you wanted to join is being shutdown. Sometimes the company just ceases to exist. People usually advise to treat difficulties and challenges as learning opportunities. More often than not any learning comes after the fact something shitty happened to you. Six months down the road you can say, &ldquo;hey, it&rsquo;s good that that bad thing happened back then, because now I&rsquo;m feeling much better&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So if I were to give a concise list of tips for job hunting out there, especially in the tech writing field:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn adjacent skils: UX writing,</li>
</ul>
